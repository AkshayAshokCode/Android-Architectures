## This repository showcases a simple Note-Taking App implemented using the following architectures:

- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- MVC (Model-View-Controller)
- MVP (Model-View-Presenter)
- MVI (Model-View-Intent)


Each architecture is implemented in its own package, providing a clear and isolated example of how the architecture can be applied to a simple Android app.
