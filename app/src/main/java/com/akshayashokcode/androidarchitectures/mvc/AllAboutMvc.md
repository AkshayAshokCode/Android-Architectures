# MVC (Model-View-Controller)

What is it?
- MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a design pattern that divides an application into three interconnected components: Model, View, and Controller. The Model represents the data and business logic, the View represents the UI, and the Controller handles the input and updates the Model and View accordingly.

When to use it?
- MVC is suitable for applications where you want a clear separation between the UI and business logic. It's particularly useful for small to medium-sized applications with straightforward UI and interaction requirements.

Why to use it?
- MVC simplifies the development process by allowing multiple developers to work simultaneously on the Model, Controller, and Views. This separation of concerns makes the codebase more modular and easier to manage. MVC also promotes code reuse and parallel development.

Advantages
- Clear separation of concerns.
- Facilitates parallel development.
- Easy to maintain and extend.
- Promotes reusable components.

Disadvantages
- Can become complex with larger applications.
- Tight coupling between Controller and View.
- Potential for code duplication in Views.

Best Practices
- Keep Controllers thin, delegating business logic to the Model.
- Use the Model to manage data and business rules.
- Ensure Views are only responsible for presenting data and not handling business logic.
- Maintain a clear and organized structure for Controllers.

Why is MVC better than other architectures, if not then why?
- MVC stands out for its simplicity and straightforward separation of responsibilities:
- Model: Manages data and business logic.
- View: Displays data and handles user interaction.
- Controller: Mediates between the Model and View, responding to user input and updating the Model or View accordingly.
- This architecture enables parallel development as developers can focus on different components simultaneously. However, as applications grow, MVC's reliance on bidirectional communication between the Controller and View can lead to tight coupling and maintenance challenges compared to MVVM and Clean Architecture.
