# MVP (Model-View-Presenter)

What is it?
- MVP (Model-View-Presenter) is a derivative of MVC that decouples the presentation layer from the business logic even further by introducing the Presenter component. The View interface and Presenter interact through interfaces, promoting easier testing and maintainability.

When to use it?
- MVP is suitable when you need a clear separation of concerns and when unit testing the presentation logic is a priority. It is particularly useful in scenarios where the UI logic is complex and needs to be tested independently of the Android framework.

Why to use it?
- MVP enhances testability by making the presentation logic unit testable. It provides a clear structure and separation of concerns, improving maintainability and readability. The Presenter handles the UI logic, while the View is responsible for rendering the UI, ensuring a clean separation of responsibilities.

Advantages
- Testable presentation logic.
- Clear separation of concerns.
- Easier to manage and maintain.
- Reusable components and interfaces.

Disadvantages
- Can lead to increased boilerplate code.
- More complex setup than MVC.
- Tight coupling between View and Presenter.

Best Practices
- Keep the Presenter free of any Android framework dependencies.
- Use interfaces to define interactions between the View and Presenter.
- Ensure the View is passive and only responsible for rendering the UI.
- Follow the single responsibility principle for Presenter classes.

Why is MVP better than other architectures, if not then why?
- MVP enhances testability and maintainability by separating concerns more explicitly than MVC:
- Model: Handles data and business logic.
- View: Displays data and handles user interactions.
- Presenter: Acts as an intermediary that retrieves data from the Model and updates the View.
- Unlike MVC, MVP ensures that the Presenter manages all UI logic, making it easier to test and modify the UI without affecting the underlying business logic. However, MVP can introduce additional complexity due to the need for explicit communication between the Presenter and View, which may be less intuitive compared to MVVM's data binding or MVI's unidirectional flow.
