# MVI (Model-View-Intent)

What is it?
- MVI (Model-View-Intent) is a design pattern that aims to provide a unidirectional data flow for managing state changes in an application. It uses intents to describe user actions, and these intents are processed to generate new states for the View.

When to use it?
- MVI is suitable for applications that require predictable state management and need to handle complex state transitions. It is particularly useful in scenarios with a lot of asynchronous events and state changes.

Why to use it?
- MVI ensures a single source of truth for the application state, making it easier to debug and reason about state changes. The unidirectional data flow simplifies the management of state and helps in avoiding common pitfalls like state corruption and race conditions.

Advantages
- Predictable state management.
- Unidirectional data flow.
- Easier to debug and reason about.
- Single source of truth for state.

Disadvantages
- Can introduce boilerplate code.
- Learning curve for those unfamiliar with the pattern.
- Overhead of managing intents and states.

Best Practices
- Keep the state immutable.
- Use a single source of truth for the state.
- Ensure intents are clearly defined and represent user actions.
- Avoid complex state transformations in the View.

Why is MVI better than other architectures, if not then why?
- MVI promotes a unidirectional data flow, enhancing predictability and maintainability in complex applications:
- Model: Represents the data state of the application.
- View: Renders UI based on the state received from the Model.
- Intent: Represents user actions or intents to change the state.
- By ensuring that state changes are handled through a single source of truth (the Model), MVI simplifies debugging and testing. However, MVI can introduce boilerplate code and require a deeper understanding of reactive programming concepts, which may increase the learning curve compared to MVVM and MVP.
